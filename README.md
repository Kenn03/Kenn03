_With the growing trend in tech, I find it necessary for each and everyone of us to be highly active in this new revolution coz it is evident that the world is changing.
This is where tech gurus get to showcase their passion for tech by bringing in new ideas with the aim of making Earth a better place to live in.
Programming to many may seem like solving a calculus math prolem but as you dig deep into it you get to realise how much you can realy create in a short span
Programming and photography to some extent have similar context coz both involve creating ideas hence I decided to focus on both and try and combine them as one
I am sure with the necessary tools and equipment then this is the path I am destined for.
WISH ME LUCK AS I EMBARK ON THIS JOURNEY!!
